"""Guards on the research archive's merge stage: which record wins, and what a rebuild keeps.

Every class here locks behavior that was measurably WRONG on the live archive:

1. ``latest/<qid>.json`` was chosen by a raw-string timestamp sort, and a question's
   comment is published minutes AFTER its research runs, so the lossy comment
   reconstruction beat the authoritative GHA artifact on 255 of the 256 questions that
   had both — leaving ``latest/`` at 25 artifact / 989 backfill.
2. Ranking by source class exposed a THIRD writer hiding inside the artifact class:
   ``backfill_research_from_logs`` keys ``qid`` on the POST id, so promoting it made
   ``latest/43592`` serve question 43591's research (and ``latest/43602`` serve 43599's),
   with a post_id healed off a sibling forging the id that made the reader accept it.
3. ``--skip-download`` rebuilt from the backfill dir alone while ``build_archive``
   overwrote ``by_qid/`` wholesale. Since artifact records live nowhere else, one
   invocation took the live archive from 280 artifact records to 27, unrecoverably
   without a re-download.
