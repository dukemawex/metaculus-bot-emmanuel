    key because it routes through a free-tier Google AI Studio BYOK key with no
    Pro free tier (quota 0). Temporary workaround pending the Metaculus-side BYOK
    fix; see the ``TODO(gemini-3.1-pro-donated)`` tag on that constant.

# Kalshi catalogue pull: a WALL-CLOCK budget for the whole paginated fetch, retries
# included, so pagination can never push the snapshot past its own timeout. The
# per-page ``aiohttp.ClientTimeout`` sits under this wall, not beside it.
#
# ``KALSHI_PAGE_SLEEP_S`` = 0.25 is MEASURED, on the value itself. Six full cold pulls
# through the real ``kalshi_prefetch_events`` (2026-08-04/05, free unauthenticated GETs,
# ``scratch/market_port_2026-08-04/kalshi_page_sleep_probe.py``, receipts in that
# directory's ``qa_artifacts/``) all completed: 10,083-10,093 events over 51 pages every
# time, ZERO 429s, wall 16.90-25.37s against this 40s cap. Compare the zero-sleep baseline
# it replaced — an HTTP 429 on 2 of 4 pulls, 8-18% of the catalogue lost — and the
# 0.25 value is doing the work it was introduced for. That matters because a 429 is
# deliberately non-retryable for this venue: the pull stops, reports incomplete, and bumps
# BOTH degradation counters, so the sleep value can redden CI on a condition it causes.
#
# The wall decomposes exactly, which is what makes the headroom trustworthy rather than
# lucky: 50 sleeps x 0.25 = 12.50s fixed, plus 4.29-12.77s of actual fetch, residual
# ~0.10s. So the sleep is HALF to THREE-QUARTERS of the elapsed pull and the worst
# observed case used 63% of the wall. Only the run's first question pays it (6h TTL cache),
# and it does not move ``SNAPSHOT_STAGE_BUDGET_S`` (stage 1a already takes the max of the
# author wall, this wall, and the HTTP stage).
#
# Headroom to raise it if a 429 ever returns: 0.3 projects to ~27.8s and 0.4 to ~32.8s at
# the worst measured fetch, so 0.4 is the practical ceiling under this wall — beyond it
# ``attempt_budget`` (which doubles as the per-page HTTP timeout) starves the late pages
# and trades throttle-loss for wall-timeout-loss, bumping the same two counters. Raising
# the wall alongside is the other lever.
#
# One residual observation, benign but worth knowing before re-probing: back-to-back pulls
# 60s apart got monotonically slower (fetch 4.47 -> 8.15 -> 12.77s), and the same cadence
# at 120s gaps stayed flat (4.29 / 4.41 / 7.11s). That looks like soft rate pressure that
# drains, never a 429, and prod pulls the catalogue once per run — so it constrains probe
# design (space pulls out, or a probe's own cadence manufactures the slowdown it reports)
# rather than the constant.
# EVENT_LIMIT is a runaway guard well above the ~10.1k live open events; MAX_PAGES is
# the real bound.

# How far past an OPEN displayed edge a rendered band may sit before the magnitude backstop
# treats it as a wrong-quantity anchor, measured in multiples of the displayed span. An open
# edge means the outcome genuinely can settle beyond it, so the constraint has to loosen
# there — but treating open as "no constraint at all" disarmed the backstop entirely on the
# ~95% of numeric questions that carry two open bounds.
#
# The measured window is wide, and BOTH ends are pinned by tests so a future tweak has to
# confront the evidence. The rule compares the NEAREST BAND EDGE (not the P50) against the
# range, which is what makes the window wide: every band the anchor has actually published
# overlaps its own range, so it scores 0.00 spans outside and no tolerance below 1.0 can
# suppress it. Meanwhile the wrong-quantity shapes this exists to catch — a percent-unit band
# on a basis-point question — sit 0.63-0.73 outside, so anything at or above ~0.63 stops
# catching them (a 1.0 tolerance catches nothing, which is why the value is well under it).
# Closed edges get no tolerance at all: the outcome cannot settle past them, so the original
# zero-overlap rule stands there unchanged and this whole knob is inert.
